This paper proposes AMAP-Stitching, which aims to preserve as much as possible content in image stitching, and avoid losing too much information in the irregular boundary cropping, so that the shape stitched images can be normalized to be the rectangle.
In our method, the traditional stitching is improved by considering the content-preserving constraint, and the stitching process is configured to be a two-step global optimization which can be efficiently solved.
With a grid mesh on each images for stitching, we first conduct stitching by traditional warping-based optimization, and get the outer rectangle of stitching results.
Then, we obtain the boundary vertices on the irregular warped meshes by the polygon boolean operations.
With the boundary vertices, we proceed the second step optimization to preserve the feature alignment, local shape, and global features.
To reduce the distortion after rectangling, we optimize the rectangling strategy in a content-aware manner.
We further extend the idea of AMAP-stitching to videos and Sefie photography, and integrate the temporal coherence and portrait-preserving into the optimization.
Experiments show that our method can efficiently produce visual-pleasing results with unnoticeable distortion and artifacts.

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}

\IEEEPARstart{I}{mage} stitching is a well-studied problem, which has been successfully applied to smart phones and portable cameras, and people can easily take panorama images simply by moving cameras. Previous methods \cite{journals/ftcgv/Szeliski06,journals/pami/ZaragozaCTBS14,conf/eccv/ChenC16}mainly focus on accurate alignment, seamless and natural stitching.
However, most stitching results have irregular boundaries, and the final panorama images are obtained by cropping, which may lose image content and reduce the impression of wide angle photography. In order to produce panorama images with regular boundaries, image completion techniques\cite{journals/mta/YenYC17,journals/tog/BarnesSFG09} are used to synthesize the missing region in the bounding box. However, these methods are not stable, and may fail to synthesize semantic contents in images.
To generate panorama images with regular boundaries, He et al. \cite{journals/tog/HeC013} proposed a warping based method to rectangling panorama images, which can stably produce visual-pleasing panorama images with regular boundaries. Although useful and effective, their method treats stitching and rectangling as two individual processes, thus has the following limitations: (1) the rectangling and stitching may affect each other, thus it is hard to get optimized results; (2) it is hard to place grid meshes in irregular input panoramas, and meshes on the boundaries may contain small holes. (3) the warping of the stitched images may degrade the quality of panorama.
Actually, rectangling and stitching are tightly related, and combination of the two processes may help to produce better rectangling panorama in a content-aware manner.
In this paper, we present a global

then produce rectangle results by seam carving and warping.
